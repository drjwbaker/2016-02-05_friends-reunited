	<h1>Friends Reunited Privacy Policy</h1>
</section>    

<div id="column" class="terms spaced"> 
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to  Friends Reunited Limited, a company registered in England and Wales (Company  Number 03932836) and the operator of the www.friendsreunited.co.uk website.  This Privacy Policy explains how we use information that we receive about you  when you use the website and how we make sure it is stored and managed, safely  and legally.</p>

<p>We are registered as a data  controller with the UK Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office in accordance with the  Data Protection Act 1998. Our registration number is Z5218910. You can check  our registration online if you want to. </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is part of  the <a href="/Terms" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a> of using this website, so please read it carefully. We take your privacy extremely seriously, and will store all your personal  information securely in line with good professional practice and applicable  data protection laws.</p>

<h3>The laws you&rsquo;re protected by. </h3>
<p>As we are a UK company, you  are protected by UK and European data protection laws. You can find out more  about data protection in general on the <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk" target="_blank">UK Information Commissioner's Office website </a>. </p>

<h3>Information we receive about  you. </h3>
<p>We always aim to gather only  the information that we need in order to provide you with the service you have  subscribed to.</p>
<p>Registration and other  information. At registration, you provide us with information about yourself  such as your name, email address, year of birth and gender. We also receive  information from you when you pay for a product, get in contact with us, and  sometimes if you reply to a survey.</p>
<p>Information you choose to  share. If you create content on the website, which may include uploading  personal information in the &lsquo;About me&rsquo; section or uploading photos and  comments, we also receive that information. This may include personal  information about you and other people (for example, names and birthdays of  people in your family).</p>
<p>Information other members  share about you. We may also receive information from other members, such as  when they upload content relating to you, tag photos of you, or post comments  in relation to your memories or Friends Reunited groups. </p>
<p>Photo tagging. Photo tagging  is creating a link from a photo or other information identifying you back to  your profile. If a contact tags you in an uploaded photo, for example, that tag  will link back to your profile. Your contact will be able to view any photos  and Friend Groups which you have permitted them to access through your settings,  and other information on your page. You, or the member who created the tag, can  remove a tag about you. You always have the option of blocking a contact. More  information about blocking contacts can be found on the website. </p>
<p>Other information we receive  about you. </p>
<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>Whenever  you visit the website, we receive information about what you do during your  visit, such as when you perform searches, send messages, click advertisements,  keep photos, or purchase products. We receive this  information through cookies. You can find out more about our use of cookies below. </li>
	<li>We  also receive some information about the computer or other device you use to  access our service, such as your IP address, the browser you use, your  location, how big your screen is, or the pages you visit. </li>
	<li>When  you upload a photo or video, we may also receive additional information through  metadata about where that photo or video was taken, such as the time, date and  location. </li>
	<li>We  may also receive statistical, anonymised information from our advertising  partners who work with us to deliver more relevant, higher quality advertising  to you on the website and to understand online activity. </li>
	<li>We  may also receive information from other websites, such as Facebook, when you  log into the website using Facebook Platform. You can find out more about this  under Sharing with other websites and applications <a href="http://www.friendsreunited.co.uk/Privacy#sharing">below</a>. </li>
</ul>

<h3>What we use this information  for.</h3>
<p>We use the information we  receive about you through your use of the website, and the services we provide  to you on the website, for the purposes set out below (which are discussed in  further detail throughout this Privacy Policy):</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>managing  the website (including your account); </li>
	<li>providing  advanced website features to you;</li>
	<li>suggesting  and providing relevant content to you on the website;</li>
	<li>understanding  your needs to help us improve the website; </li>
	<li>improving  search results; </li>
	<li>understanding  website usage to help us improve our marketing or the way we do business; and</li>
	<li>sending  you emails or other communications (more details below).</li>
</ul>
<p>You give us permission to use  your information for the above purposes in relation to our current service, and  also in relation to any new products and features which we may provide to you  in the future as part of our service. </p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t sell your information  to third parties.</p>
<p>If we run a promotion or competition where  your information will be shared with a third party for marketing purposes, we  will make that very clear and will ask your permission first.</p>

<h3>Emails and communications.</h3>
<p>You are probably most  interested in how we will use your email address to communicate with you, so  here's our email promise: </p>
<p>Service emails. We will never  ever send you unsolicited emails without your permission, but there are some  emails that we will send you to provide you with a good service. These include  notifications that you have a message from a contact, reminders about your  membership and guides on how to use the website. A full list of the types of  emails you will receive to help you use the service most effectively (which we  call &lsquo;service emails&rsquo;) are shown below: </p>
<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>Validation  email – emails to verify your email address when you first register and aim to  prevent fraudulent or automated registration;</li>
	<li>Welcome  emails – emails which explain how to use the website when you first join;</li>
	<li>Key  service messages – emails to notify you about changes to the service; </li>
	<li>New  message notification and reminders – emails to let you know when you receive  messages from other members; </li>
	<li>Emails  from members inviting you to view their content;</li>
    <li>Notes/profile/comments/photo  and video approval notification; </li>
    <li>Verification  email – emails to verify your email address is still valid after a long absence from the site; and</li>
	<li>Service  suspension notices – if you break the house rules. </li>
</ul>

<p>Memory alerts/ Nostalgia  newsletters. As well as service emails, you may also receive memory alerts and  our occasional newsletters (if you have opted to receive them). These emails  help you to make the most of the website and let you know when there is new fun  and interesting stuff to do. Here is a bit more information about them... </p>
<p>Friend Group alerts: They are an  essential part of our service because they tell you about recent activity  relating to your Friend Groups. The good thing about these alerts is that they  let you know when you should pop back to the website. Without them you would  never know there was new stuff to read. </p>
<p>Friends Reunited newletters: When  registering, we give you the option of receiving our occasional newsletters. We  use these to notify you about new features on the website, ask your opinion,  and tell you about services you might not be using yet. If you sign up to  receive our newsletters, we may also email you information and news about our  sister websites, Genes Reunited and Friends Reunited Dating. Newsletters may  also contain advertising from companies we think you might like or be  interested in.</p>
<p>If at any time you decide you  don't want to receive the memory alerts or nostalgia newsletters – or if you  aren&rsquo;t currently receiving them and want to – all you need to do is change your  settings in your email preferences. You'll find these options in the <a href="/Account" target="_blank">Edit Your  Account page</a>. There are also instructions on every email we send,  and you can usually unsubscribe directly from the email. </p>
<p>Offers, competitions and  services from third party companies. You may also opt in to receive occasional  information, offers and services from third party companies that we think you  might like or be interested in. If you decide you no longer want to receive  these communications – or if you aren't currently receiving them and want to –  all you need to do is change your email preferences. You'll find this in the <a href="/Account" target="_blank">Edit Your  Account</a> area once you're logged in. There are also instructions on  every email we send, and you can usually unsubscribe directly from the email  without visiting the website. </p>

<a name="cookies" id="cookies"></a>
<h3>Our use of cookies. </h3>
<p>Information gathered on  registration. When you register for our service, you provide your name, year of  birth, gender and email address.  You can change these details through the Edit Your <a href="/Account" target="_blank">Account</a>  page. Please update your details with relevant changes as soon as possible to  ensure we have the correct information for you on your account.</p>
<p>Cookies. We use small text  files known as &quot;cookies&quot; to enhance your experience of our service as  follows: </p>
<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>To  hold an encryted login code, so that you do not need to log  in each time you visit the website, and your homepage is personalised. This  option can be turned off by logging out, and unticking the &ldquo;Keep me signed in&rdquo;  option when you next sign in; </li>
	<li>To  facilitate optimal use of our service by means of a temporary &ldquo;session&rdquo; cookie  which helps you to navigate through the website and enhances your user  experience. These cookies disappear when your browser session ends, or when you  click the &ldquo;Signout&rdquo; link on the website homepage; and </li>
	<li>To  help us recognise you as a unique visitor by means of a &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookie  when you return to our website and to allow us to tailor content or  advertisements to match your preferred interests or to avoid showing you the  same adverts and messages repeatedly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Analytical cookies. We also  use analytical cookies and similar analytical tools to compile anonymous,  aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our service and  to help us improve the structure of our website. This is not personal data, and  we cannot identify you in this way. These cookies allow us to understand who  has seen which pages and advertisements on the website, to determine how  frequently particular pages and advertisements are visited, to determine the  most popular areas of the website, and generally to monitor usage of the  website. We will also use aggregate non-personal data to track the success of  any advertising campaigns on our website, to improve the effectiveness and  suitability of advertising in communications sent by us and other companies in  the Friends Reunited group and/or to provide to third parties anonymised,  demographic data provided by you to target advertising more appropriately. We  do not provide our advertising partners with information that identifies you as  an individual. </p>

<p>Third party cookies. Some of  the web analytics companies and advertisers used on the website may also place  tracking cookies on your web browsers and/or computer. These cookies and  embedded code are used for tracking the success of advertising campaigns. These  cookies are normally permanent. Advertisers on our website and newsletters may  also use cookies and similar analytical tools (both on our website and  elsewhere) to monitor the success of the advertising, to control the frequency  and repetition of advertisements and to ensure that advertising is relevant to  individual users. This helps us to keep the website free of charge.</p>
<p>Further information. Please  contact our <a href="/Home/ContactUs" target="_blank">customer support service</a> to request further details about  individual cookies used on our website by us and by third parties.</p>
<p>Disabling cookies. Most  internet browsers are automatically set up to accept cookies, but you can set  your browser to refuse a cookie by changing your browser security settings, or  you can ask your browser to show you where a cookie has been set up. You may  also be asked to consent to the use of certain cookies upon entering or  registering on our website. Certain features on our website are only activated  by the presence of a cookie so, if you do not accept certain cookies, our  website might not work properly, and particular features of this website may  not be available to you. You can find out more on how to disable/enable cookies  via the following link http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.</p>

<h3>Privacy settings. </h3>

<p>We understand that privacy is  important to you, so we provide a number of ways for you to change your privacy  settings in relation to your photos. </p>
<p>Information that always remains  public:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>Profile  Page. Your profile page, including your user name can be viewed by  any other member. Only &lsquo;public&rsquo; Friend Groups that you have created or joined,  however, will be displayed on your profile. Any Friend Groups you have chosen to  join &lsquo;private&rsquo; will not be displayed on your profile. </li>
</ul>
<p>Information that always  remains private:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>News  stream. On news page, your mFriend Group news shows your recent activity on  your account. Your news is personal to you, and is not viewable by other  members of our service. </li>
	<li>Keepsafe.  Only you can directly view your Keepsafe. Only you can see any photos or video you have kept. Any Friend Groups that  you have created and that you have chosen to make public, however, will be  viewable by everyone, meaning all members and non-members. </li>
	<li>Private  groups. Only you and any members you specifically invite are able to  search, view and interact with your private photos and Friend Groups. For more  about privacy settings in relation to Friend Groups, please see below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sending messages. Some information  that you choose to upload onto our service, such as when you post comments  relating to a public friend group, will always be publicly available, although it  will appear as an anonymous message to non-members. You can find out more about  sending private messages to other members on our website. </p>
<p>Friend Groups. You can control  who can view and interact with your Friend Groups through three different  privacy settings. When you create a friend group, you are given the option of  keeping the setting as &lsquo;public&rsquo; or changing it to either &lsquo;shared&rsquo; or &lsquo;private&rsquo;.  Here is a bit more information on each type of setting:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>Public  Friend Groups are searchable and viewable by all members and non-members where  you invite them to view your photos or comments. Members may choose to  join these Friend Groups and their contents on their own Keepsafe, and are also  able to interact with this content. Non-members are able to view the content  but cannot interact with it. You can make a public or shared Friend Group, which  you own or manage, private by: 
<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>clicking  on its name where it appears in the left column of your page;</li>
	<li>clicking  the 'Edit this Friend Group' link which appears towards the top of the Friend Group's  individual page; and </li>
	<li>making  this change via the 'Choose which type of Friend Group to make?' section. </li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Shared  Friend Groups are searchable and viewable on the website by all members. Any  member is able to join these Friend Groups and their contents in their own  Keepsafe, but only people you invite to join the friend group will be able to  add new content to the Friend Group.</li>
	<li>Private  Friend Groups are not searchable. Only members whom you invite to these friend group will be able to view and join the Friend Groups and their contents in  their own Keepsafe. Only the people you invite are able to add new content to  the Friend Group.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="sharing" id="sharing"></a>
<h3>Sharing with other websites and applications.</h3>
<p>Logging into the website using  Facebook. You can log in to the website using the Facebook Platform. When you  log in using Facebook, Facebook shares selective information with us, such as  your gender, date of birth, name and location, but we do not share information  we hold about you with Facebook through your use of this facility. </p>
<p>Sharing links to photos and Friend Groups. By using the &lsquo;Share&rsquo; links on the website, you can share your  content and Friend Groups with non-members using Facebook, Twitter and email.  The content will remain at all times on the website and only the link and other  limited information will appear on Facebook and Twitter, or in the email. There  are restrictions on the sharing of content that we provide to you on the  website. You can find out more about these restrictions in our <a href="/Terms" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

<h3>We use high quality security  technology and processes.</h3>
<p>We aim to keep your details  safe when you sign in or pay by using encryption. You can find out more about  encryption via this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption</a> We always use up-to-date technology security standards and make every effort to  keep our systems as secure as they can reasonably be. Please be aware that,  although our systems are as secure as they reasonably can be, your information  might be intercepted on its way to us via the internet, although it is  extremely uncommon for this to happen. Keep your sign in details private at all  times and do not share them with anybody. </p>

<h3>Where your information is  stored.</h3>
<p>The vast majority of your  information is stored securely on our servers in Scotland, UK. Some of our  third party partners use servers in the United States. When we process data in  the United States, we only use providers certified under the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018365.asp" target="_blank">EU-approved Safe Harbor scheme </a></p>

<h3>We don&rsquo;t store your payment  card information.</h3>
<p>When we take a payment from  you, we use a secure third party service to process the payment and do not keep  a record of your credit or debit card details in our systems. This means that,  even if someone broke into our systems, your payment details would not be  available for them to steal. </p>

<h3>When we might disclose your  information. </h3>
<p>We may share data supplied by  you (or collected about you) with other companies in the corporate group of  which we form a part (meaning Friends Reunited Limited, Brightsolid Online  Innovation Limited, and any of their subsidiaries from time to time), but only  for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>The only circumstances in  which we will share any of the information we receive about you to a third  party are if we:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>have  informed you first, for example by setting it out in this Privacy Policy;</li>
	<li>have  received your permission first; </li>
	<li>have  removed any personally identifiable information before sharing it; or</li>
	<li>are  required or otherwise permitted to do so by law or where we are using a third  party supplier to provide part of our   service to you – such as delivering a product to your home.  If that happens we will ensure our supplier  does not use the information for anything else.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using third parties to process  your information.</h3>
<p>The only circumstances in  which we will provide any of your personal data to a third party are those  contained in this Privacy Policy or if we are required to under law. We  occasionally use third party companies to manage information that you provide  us with: for example, when you complete a survey or pay for a product. When we  do, we keep the amount of personal information they hold to an absolute  minimum, have contracts in place to stop them using your information except on  our behalf and obviously use reasonable efforts to make sure they are as  careful with your information as we are. </p>

<h3>Removing your profile from  Friends Reunited.</h3>
<p>You may remove your profile  from the website at any time by clicking the &ldquo;Account&rdquo; link located towards the  top right of the website, and clicking &ldquo;Remove my account from Friends  Reunited&rdquo;. Any public content you have added to the website will remain;  however, your profile page will not be accessible, and other members will not  be able to contact you. Any content that you chose to share publicly,  understandably, may be copied or stored by other members even after your  profile has been removed. When your profile has been removed, we will archive  and store your information for a reasonable time period for legal and  administrative reasons and for the purposes of re-activating your account with  us, if you wish to do so. <br />

<h3>Updating your personal  information.</h3>
<p>If the information we hold  about you is no longer correct, please update your details in the &ldquo;Account&rdquo;  section of the website or, alternatively, <a href="/Home/ContactUs" target="_blank">let us know</a> and we will update our records. In certain situations, we may choose not to  amend your personal information. In this event, we will include an appropriate  statement or note about it adjacent to or with the information.</p>

<h3>Seeing what information we  hold on you.</h3>
<p>If you want to know what  personal information we hold on you, get in <a href="/Home/ContactUs" target="_blank">contact</a>,  and we&rsquo;ll be happy to supply you with it. There is a £10 administration charge  to cover the cost of pulling it together.</p>

<h3>If we change hands.</h3>
